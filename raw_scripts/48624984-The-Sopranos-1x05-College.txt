Fidgety, Tony flips through the BATES CATALOG. He steals a glance at the student worker talking silently on the phone, picks up the student newspaper: 

FRONT PAGE 

Headline: GAY-LESBIAN STUDENTS' UNION -- MONDO WEEKEND. 

TONY 

Quizzical. Puts the paper aside.

MEADOW 

Are you in the mafia?
